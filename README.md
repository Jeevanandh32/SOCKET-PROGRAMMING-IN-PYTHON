Here is an inch-by-inch breakdown of the client-side Python code, which connects to a server, solves mathematical problems sent by the server, and communicates back with the server.

Imports

import socket import sys

socket: This module is required to create and work with network connections using sockets (both TCP and UDP). In this case, we are working with a TCP socket. sys: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions. Here, it is imported but not explicitly used.

Math-Solving Function

def solve_math(question): _, num1, op, num2 = question.split() num1, num2 = int(num1), int(num2)

solve_math: This function takes a mathematical question sent by the server as a string (e.g., "MATH 12 + 23"). question.split(): The input string is split into four components: the keyword "MATH", two numbers (num1 and num2), and an operator (op). num1, num2 = int(num1), int(num2): Converts the numbers from strings to integers for computation.

if not (0 < num1 < 100 and 0 < num2 < 100): print("Error: Numbers must be one or two digits.") return "INVALID"

Ensures that both num1 and num2 are within the range 1–99. If they aren’t, an error message is printed, and the function returns "INVALID" to indicate the question doesn’t meet the problem’s constraint.

if op == '+': return num1 + num2 elif op == '-': return num1 - num2 elif op == '*': return num1 * num2 elif op == '/': return num1 // num2 # Integer division

This section performs the appropriate mathematical operation based on the operator op: +: Addition -: Subtraction *: Multiplication /: Integer division using // to avoid decimal results. The computed result is returned to the caller.

Client-Side Socket Setup and Connection

def run_client(): HOST = '127.0.0.1' PORT = 8888

run_client: The main function that starts the client. HOST: Defines the IP address the client connects to. 127.0.0.1 is the loopback address (local machine), meaning the client is communicating with a server running on the same machine. PORT: The port number the client will connect to (here, 8888).

with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:

socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM): Creates a new socket. AF_INET: Specifies IPv4 as the address family. SOCK_STREAM: Specifies TCP as the transport protocol. with: Ensures that the socket (s) is properly closed after the block of code is executed, even if an exception occurs.

Connection Establishment and Data Handling

   try:
        s.connect((HOST, PORT))
        s.settimeout(10)  # Set a 10-second timeout
s.connect((HOST, PORT)): Establishes a connection to the server at the specified IP address and port. s.settimeout(10): Sets a timeout of 10 seconds for all blocking operations on the socket. This prevents the client from waiting indefinitely if the server doesn’t respond.

       welcome = s.recv(1024).decode().strip()
        print(f"Server: {welcome}")
s.recv(1024): Receives up to 1024 bytes of data from the server. This data is expected to be in byte format. .decode().strip(): Converts the received bytes to a string and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The welcome message from the server is printed to the console.

Sending the Husky Username to the Server

       husky_name = input("Enter your Husky username: ")
        intro = f"HELLO {husky_name}\n"
        print(f"Sending: {intro.strip()}")
        s.sendall(intro.encode())
input(): Prompts the user to enter their Husky username. intro = f"HELLO {husky_name}\n": Constructs a greeting message to introduce the client to the server. s.sendall(intro.encode()): Sends the introduction message to the server. .encode() converts the string into bytes.

Receiving and Processing Server Messages while True: data = s.recv(1024).decode().strip() print(f"Server: {data}")

while True:: A loop that continuously listens for messages from the server. s.recv(1024): Waits to receive up to 1024 bytes of data from the server. data: The decoded message from the server is stored in data. print(f"Server: {data}"): Prints the message received from the server to the console.

Handling Different Server Messages

           if data.startswith("DONE"):
                print(f"Received flag: {data.split()[1]}")
                break
if data.startswith("DONE"): Checks if the server has sent a "DONE" message, which signals the end of the session. data.split()[1]: Extracts the second part of the message, which is the unique flag generated by the server. break: Breaks the loop and exits the program.

           elif data.startswith("MATH"):
                answer = solve_math(data)
                response = f"ANSWER {answer}\n"
                print(f"Sending: {response.strip()}")
                s.sendall(response.encode())
elif data.startswith("MATH"): Checks if the server has sent a math problem (message starts with "MATH"). answer = solve_math(data): Calls the solve_math function to compute the answer. response = f"ANSWER {answer}\n": Constructs the response message in the format "ANSWER result". s.sendall(response.encode()): Sends the computed answer back to the server.

           elif not data:
                print("No data received. Exiting.")
                break
If no data is received from the server, the client prints an exit message and breaks out of the loop, closing the connection.

Exception Handling

   except socket.timeout:
        print("Socket timeout occurred. Exiting.")
    except ConnectionRefusedError:
        print("Connection refused. Make sure the server is running.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
socket.timeout: If a timeout occurs (the server doesn't respond in 10 seconds), an error message is printed, and the client exits. ConnectionRefusedError: If the server is not running or refuses the connection, this error is caught. Exception: Any other exceptions are caught and the error is printed.

Main Block

if name == "main": run_client()

This block ensures that the run_client function is only executed if the script is run directly (not imported as a module). It starts the client process.

Summary The client connects to a server, introduces itself with a Husky username, receives math problems, solves them, and sends the answers back. It handles errors such as timeouts and connection refusal gracefully. When the session is done, it receives a unique flag from the server and exits.
